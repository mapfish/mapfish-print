This example demonstrates aliasing and attribute defaults.

# YAML Aliasing

Yaml has a feature called "Aliases" which allows the same object to be used in multiple places by
\_[tagging]() the object of interest with an alias and then \_[dereferencing]() the alias later when one
wishes to reuse the objct.

The purpose of YAML aliasing in a YAML file is to reduce duplication in the files.

A YAML object can be tagged with a &TAG*NAME and then reused using \*TAG_NAME as a dereference. It is
important to remember that this is \_not* a copy of the object, it is the same object, thus any changes to the
object (by a setter for example) will affect all referencing instance.

For example:

: maxDpi: &MAX_DPI 254 \# declaring the alias MAX_DPI ref: \*MAX_DPI \# dereferencing the alias

# Defaults

This example also demonstrates the use of default attribute values. All Attributes have an optional property
called default. This mechanism allows default values to be set in the configuration file and allows the client
to ignore those attributes unless it wants to specifically override the default values.
