    An Attribute is a value the that a processor requires as its input (if it is not satisfied by the output of another processor) or the
    report template. An attribute represents one or more values. Usually simple values (numbers, strings, etc...) are values required by
    the report template but on occasion they might be required by a processor. Typically a processor will require a specific attribute
    type, for example the <a href="#/processors#!createMap">!createMap</a> processor requires a <a href="#/attributes#!map">!map</a>
    attribute, which contains all of the information required to render a map (layers, bbox, projections, etc...)
</p><p>
    Attributes are declared in the configuration yaml file in the !attribute block. The
    attribute block is a map of name - > attributeType pairs. This means that each attribute consists of a name and a type. Each processor
    has a inputs which must be satisfied by an attribute or the output of another processor. Each input has a name/key that is used to
    look up the attribute (or output). If an input of a processor is not satisfied, an error will be reported to the client detailing the
    attribute(s) that are missing.
</p><p>
    All attributes can have a <em>default</em> block where the values of the attribute can be supplied. As the term implies, an attribute
    with default values does not need to be supplied by the client (although they can be overridden). Further, if an attribute has
    multiple values the default block may only provide defaults for a subset of the values (the client must supply the rest).

    Defaults provide a way to make the API the client must use to be very simple (when designing a custom client) but remain flexible.
