### The processor graph is more strict

-   No more able to override an attribute.
-   The order is important, unable to get the output from a processor placed after
    e.g. the `!createScaleBar` should be after the `!createMap` processor.
-   In the `!prepareLegend` processor, the legend output is renamed to `legendDataSource`.
-   In the `!prepareTable` processor, the table output is renamed to `tableDataSource`.
-   In the mapContext the method `getRoundedScale` is renamed to `getRoundedScaleDenominator`.
-   In the Jasper template `$P{mapContext}.getScale().getDenominator()` should be replace by
    `$P{mapContext}.getRoundedScaleDenominator()`.
-   The longtime deprecated imageFormat on OSM layer is removed.
-   The fake projection `EPSG:900913` is no more supported, you should use the projection `EPSG:3857`.
-   The KVP WMTS layers should specify a real mime type in the `FORMAT`.
-   For native WMS rotation, the angle or map_angle shouldn't be in the customParams,
    and the `serverType` is required, to disable it `useNativeAngle` to `false` on the layer.
