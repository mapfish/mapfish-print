The server will return a reference ID of the print job for obtaining the report and the status    </li>    <li>        Once the create request returns the client will poll the server asking about the status of the print.    </li>    <li>        Once the status request returns the completion response (and not an error) then the client will make the GET report request.    </li> </ul> ",
  "overviewPageArchitecturalDiagramPostInfo" : "This diagram illustrates how a client (web-client or Java application) communicates with the Mapfish Print Server.  In the case of a Java application the communication is directly with the Java Servlet Object and for web-client via http requests.

  "overviewPageArchitectureExplanation" : "<p>    On the server side, once a create request is received the server will create a Print Job and send it to Job Manager, which is    responsible for running the print job asynchronously (possibly on a completely different server) and allowing the http request to    return a response to the user without waiting for the print job to complete. As an aside, there is a createAndGet request that will    wait until the printing is done and directly return the report without having to poll to see if the print is done. This is a    convenience for client makers. </p> <p>    While creating the Print Job all of the <a href=\"#/attributes\">attributes</a> are parsed from the JSON and a Job Reference Id is    generated to uniquely identify the job is create. </p> <p>    Once the Print Job is started, the <a href=\"#/attributes\">attributes</a> are passed to the <a href=\"#/processors\">processors</a>. The    processor work with the <a href=\"#/attributes\">attributes</a> in order to generate the maps, tables, legends, etc... that are required    by the <a href=\"#/outputFormats\">output format</a> (Jasper template). </p> <p>    Once the <a href=\"#/processors\">processors</a> have all completed execution all of the values are passed to the <a        href=\"#/outputFormats\">output format</a> which uses that information to generate the report. In theory an <a href=\"#/outputFormats\">output    format</a> could be anything that generates a report. However the current version uses the    <a href=\"http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library\">Jasper Reports Library</a> for its outputs and several of the    processors are Jasper reports focuses.    Because of this the documentation will assume that the output format is always based on    <a href=\"http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library\">Jasper Reports</a>. </p> <p>    The <a href=\"#/outputFormats\">output format</a> will generate a report and store it in some way for later retrieval. At this point the    status request would return a response indicating that the print job has completed. </p> ",

An attribute represents one or more values. Usually simple values (numbers, strings, etc...) are values required by    the report template but on occasion they might be required by a processor. Typically a processor will require a specific attribute    type, for example the <a href=\"#/processors#!createMap\">!createMap</a> processor requires a <a href=\"#/attributes#!map\">!map</a>    attribute, which contains all of the information required to render a map (layers, bbox, projections, etc...) </p><p>    Attributes are declared in the configuration yaml file in the !attribute block. The    attribute block is a map of name - > attributeType pairs. This means that each attribute consists of a name and a type. Each processor    has a inputs which must be satisfied by an attribute or the output of another processor. Each input has a name/key that is used to    look up the attribute (or output). If an input of a processor is not satisfied, an error will be reported to the client detailing the    attribute(s) that are missing. </p><p>    All attributes can have a <em>default</em> block where the values of the attribute can be supplied. As the term implies, an attribute    with default values does not need to be supplied by the client (although they can be overridden). Further, if an attribute has    multiple values the default block may only provide defaults for a subset of the values (the client must supply the rest). </p><p>    Defaults provide a way to make the API the client must use to be very simple (when designing a custom client) but remain flexible. </p>",

The name is the value that is        put in the config file when configuring Mapfish print.    </li>    <li>Description: the full description for each processor can be found by expanding one of the list elements.</li>    <li>Configuration: the configuration options are also listed when a processor element is expanded. A configuration option is a value        that can be set on the processor in the configuration yaml file. These options are consistent across all print jobs because they        are not provided by the client.    </li>    <li>Input: the required input values of the processor are listed when the processor element is in expanded form.

A support processor is a processor that in some way prepares attributes for    for the </em>primary</em> processors. For example, there are processors that can add layers to the map so that all maps will have the    layers (reducing the data the client needs to send.) Another example are several processors which configure how http requests are make    (add cookies, headers, remap URLs, etc...) </p> <p>    A processor usually has inputs and outputs, in the simple case an input is one of the attributes and the outputs all map to parameters    in the Jasper template. Each input and output have default names and often these are sufficient. </p> <p>    However consider the case where a report had two maps (or legends or....). In this case the default input and output parameter names    are not sufficient because the input attributes need to be mapped to the correct processor and the output values need to be mapped to    the correct parameters in the templates. In order to account for this case, processors have the configuration options: inputMapper and    outputMapper. </p> <p>    InputMapper and outputMapper configuration parameters can be configured as follows: <pre><code> - !createMap<br/>    inputMapper: { attributeName : defaultInputParamName}<br/>    outputMapper: { defaultOutputName : templateParamName}<br/> </code></pre>  Or if the there are multiple mappings that need to be made : <pre><code> - processorName<br/>    inputMapper :<br/>    attributeName1 : inputName1<br/>    attributeName2 : inputName2<br/> </code></pre> ",
